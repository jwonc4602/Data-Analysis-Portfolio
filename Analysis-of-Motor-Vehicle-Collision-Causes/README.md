# Analysis of Motor Vehicle Collision Causes in Toronto

## Overview

This repository analyzes motor vehicle collisions in Toronto from 2006 to 2023, focusing on how human behavior and environmental factors combine to increase accident risks. The findings identify aggressive driving as a major contributor, even under good road conditions, and suggest targeted policy interventions.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from [Open Data Toronto](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-involving-killed-or-seriously-injured-persons/).
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `other` contains details about LLM chat interactions and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean, and test data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of this project were written with the assistance of the language model, ChatGPT. Specifically, ChatGPT was used to generate discussion points, refine the title and subtitle, and help structure key arguments. The entire chat history is available in other/llm/usage.txt.

## Analysis of Canadian Grocery Prices from February to November 2024
This paper analyzes grocery price trends across eight major Canadian vendors, using data collected from Project Hammer to provide insights into price volatility and vendor-specific behaviors over time. By examining timestamped pricing records, we identify significant price fluctuations for specific vendors, particularly Metro and Voila, during certain periods, suggesting varied responses to market pressures. These findings reveal price stability and volatility patterns that differ between vendors, highlighting potential competitive dynamics and the impact on Canadian consumers. This analysis contributes to a broader understanding of grocery pricing behavior, offering valuable information for consumers, policymakers, and regulators concerned with market fairness and affordability.

## Analyzing The Nationalâ€™s Musical Trajectory from 2001 to 2023
This study analyzes the evolution of musical attributes in The Nationalâ€™s discography, focusing on danceability, energy, instrumentals, and valence across their album releases. Using data from Spotifyâ€™s API, we analyze how these attributes have fluctuated over the years and visualize their progression through a series of plots. Our findings suggest that energy and instrumentalness exhibit more variability, while danceability and valence have followed relatively smoother trajectories. These insights contribute to the growing field of music analytics by offering a deeper understanding of a famous band's artistic and sonic evolution within the indie rock genre.

##  Polls-of-Polls Forecast for the 2024 United States Presidential Election Through Generalized Linear Model
The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election has far-reaching global implications for economic, environmental, and social policy, making it a focal point for international attention. This paper applies a Bayesian generalized linear model to analyze trends in Kamala Harrisâ€™ support, accounting for pollster differences, population types, and poll recency. Despite steady support at 48%, Harris is projected to lose the national popular vote and key battleground states to Donald Trump. Our findings highlight the impact of polling methodologies and their role in shaping predictions of U.S. policy outcomes. Future research should incorporate the Electoral College to address current limitations. You can find more details [here](https://github.com/jwonc4602/2024_US_Election_Forecast).

## 23-24 English Premier League Forecast
This study develops a Bayesian regression model to predict English Premier League standings by analyzing how team performance metrics such as possession percentages, goals scored, expected goals, progressive passes, and progressive carries influence league points. The findings indicate that goals scored and expected goals are the most significant predictors of team success, providing a quantitative basis for strategic planning in football. The results demonstrate the potential of using advanced statistical methods to enhance the predictability of sports outcomes, offering valuable insights for team management and sports analysts. By quantifying the impact of specific performance metrics, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of football dynamics and emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making in professional sports.

## 2020 US Election Result Analysis

This project uses multilevel regression and post-stratification to analyze the impact of gender, education, and geography on 2020 U.S. Presidential Election voting patterns, particularly for Donald Trump. It finds significant differences in support across demographics, challenging previous assumptions about education and party support. The research highlights the importance of demographic diversity in electoral outcomes. This is featured in the [instructor's note](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/25-papers.html#previous-examples-6) and you can find more details [here](https://github.com/Kjeongwoo99/2020_US_Election_Result_Analysis).

## Balancing Efficiency and Equity in Urban Waste Management in Toronto from 2021 to 2024
Effective urban waste management is essential for sustainability, yet many cities face challenges balancing eï¬€iciency with equitable resource distribution. This paper examines demographic and housing characteristics in Toronto to assess their impact on waste generation and collection patterns with the Bayesian logistic regression model. The analysis indicates that high-density areas often experience greater servicing demands, while low-density areas may underutilize resources. The findings support recommendations to improve waste management strategies, ensure fairness, and strengthen sustainability initiatives, providing a model that other cities can adapt.

## Analysis of Motor Vehicle Collision Causes in Toronto from 2006 to 2023
This study analyzes motor vehicle collisions in Toronto from 2006 to 2023, focusing on the interaction between human behaviorsâ€”such as speeding, aggressive driving, and alcohol useâ€”and environmental conditions like visibility and road surfaces. The findings show that while environmental factors increase risks, aggressive driving is the strongest predictor of severe accidents. These results highlight the need for targeted interventions in both driver behavior and infrastructure to improve urban traï¬€ic safety.

## Forecasting Quarterback Efficiency with Passing EPA for the Latter Half of the NFL 2023 Season

To decide quarterback efficiency by predicting the 'passing_epa' for each team in the remainder of the 2023 season in the NFL, which is from week 10 to week 18, using a logistic regression model based on the earlier weeks of the season. Have over 98% accuracy and you can find more details [here](https://github.com/jwonc4602/nfl-prediction).

## Analyzing Geographic and Demographic Patterns of Homelessness in Toronto

This project addresses the complex issue of homelessness in Toronto by conducting an in-depth analysis of the demographic and geographic trends in the city's shelter system. Despite Toronto's solid shelter system, there remain gaps in service that this study aims to highlight and address. Utilizing data from the Shelter Management Information System (SMIS), this paper aims to provide an updated and comprehensive view of urban homelessness, a topic often overlooked in contemporary research. You can find more details [here](https://github.com/jwonc4602/Analyzing-Geographic-and-Demographic-Patterns-of-Homelessness).

## 1980-1982 Recession's Long-Run Effects on Unemployment, Personal Income, and Business Patterns in America

This project examines the long-term impacts of the 1980â€“1982 recession in the United States, focusing on unemployment rates, personal income, and business patterns. Analyzing historical data reveals significant, enduring negative effects on employment and income levels, suggesting that economic downturns drive shifts toward new business trends for improved marketability and financial stability. The study utilizes R programming for data analysis, leveraging sources from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Findings emphasize the need for economic policies that consider the long-term effects of recessions on labor markets and financial stability.

## Discussion about Missing Data

This paper explores the challenge of missing data in exploratory data analysis, categorizing it into three types: Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), and Missing Not At Random (MNAR), based on the framework by Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (2020). It examines strategies for managing missing data, such as dropping observations, imputation, and multiple imputation, emphasizing the importance of selecting an approach that suits the nature of the missingness. The paper also addresses the ethical considerations in handling missing data, advocating for transparency and the minimization of bias to ensure the integrity and reliability of analytical results.

# Data Analysis Projects
This repository is a personal space for storing and organizing my data analysis and data visualization projects. You will find a collection of Microsoft Excel and R files related to various data analysis tasks, especially to the economics I've worked on. If you have any questions related to this repo, feel free to reach out to me!

## 1) Analyzing Geographic and Demographic Patterns of Homelessness in Toronto

This project addresses the complex issue of homelessness in Toronto by conducting an in-depth analysis of the demographic and geographic trends in the city's shelter system. Despite Toronto's solid shelter system, there remain gaps in service that this study aims to highlight and address. Utilizing data from the Shelter Management Information System (SMIS), this paper aims to provide an updated and comprehensive view of urban homelessness, a topic often overlooked in contemporary research.

## 2) The Lasting Shadows of Economic Downturns: Unveiling the 1980–1982 Recession's Long-Run Effects on Unemployment, Personal Income, and Business Patterns in America

This project examines the long-term impacts of the 1980–1982 recession in the United States, focusing on unemployment rates, personal income, and business patterns. Analyzing historical data reveals significant, enduring negative effects on employment and income levels, suggesting that economic downturns drive shifts toward new business trends for improved marketability and financial stability. The study utilizes R programming for data analysis, leveraging sources from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Findings emphasize the need for economic policies that consider the long-term effects of recessions on labor markets and financial stability.

## 3) Discussion about Missing Data

This paper explores the challenge of missing data in exploratory data analysis, categorizing it into three types: Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), and Missing Not At Random (MNAR), based on the framework by Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (2020). It examines strategies for managing missing data, such as dropping observations, imputation, and multiple imputation, emphasizing the importance of selecting an approach that suits the nature of the missingness. The paper also addresses the ethical considerations in handling missing data, advocating for transparency and the minimization of bias to ensure the integrity and reliability of analytical results.

## 1) HP filters practice
Implemented the HP filter(Hodrick–Prescott filter) decomposition of quarterly RGDP data {Q1 1983 – Q4 2022} in the U.S from [FRED website](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/).
